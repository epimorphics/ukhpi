  %h1.heading-large UK House Price Index: change history

  %h2 August 2017 &ndash; Northern Ireland changes
  %p
    Three of the Northern Ireland regions have officially
    changed name since this service
    was first set up. While users of the app will see the new names reflected in the
    location search and the map selector, users who utilise the SPARQL
    query function should be aware the data URI for a re-named area has not changed.
    The new local authority names are:

  %ul.list.list-bullet
    %li
      Ards and North Down (formerly North Down and Ards), the URI remains:
      %code http://landregistry.data.gov.uk/id/region/north-down-and-ards
    %li
      Armagh City Banbridge and Craigavon (formerly Armagh Bainbridge and Craigavon),
      the URI remains
      %code http://landregistry.data.gov.uk/doc/region/armagh-banbridge-and-craigavon
    %li
      Derry City and Strabane (formerly Derry and Strabane), the URI remains
      %code http://landregistry.data.gov.uk/doc/region/derry-and-strabane
