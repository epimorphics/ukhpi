  %h2.heading-medium April 2019 &ndash; UK and Scotland changes
  %p
    One of the England regions has officially changed name, and two of the Scotland
    regions have changed ONS GSS code since this service was first set up. While
    users of the app will see the new name reflected in the location search
    and the map selector, users who utilise the SPARQL query function should
    be aware that the data URI for a re-named area has not changed.

  %p The new local authority name is:

  %ul.list.list-bullet
    %li
      Folkestone and Hythe (formerly Shepway),
      %br
      the URI remains:
      %code http://landregistry.data.gov.uk/id/region/shepway

  %p In Scotland:
  %ul.list.list-bullet
    %li
      Fife
      %br
      ONS GSS code: S12000047 (formerly S12000015),
      %br
      the URI remains
      %code http://landregistry.data.gov.uk/doc/region/fife
    %li
      Perth and Kinross
      %br
      ONS GSS code: S12000048 (formerly S12000024),
      %br
      the URI remains
      %code
        http://landregistry.data.gov.uk/doc/region/perth-and-kinross

  %p Date of change: 17th April 2019


  %h2.heading-medium August 2017 &ndash; Northern Ireland changes
  %p
    Three of the Northern Ireland regions have officially
    changed name since this service
    was first set up. While users of the app will see the new names reflected in the
    location search and the map selector, users who utilise the SPARQL
    query function should be aware the data URI for a re-named area has not changed.
    The new local authority names are:

  %ul.list.list-bullet
    %li
      Ards and North Down (formerly North Down and Ards), the URI remains:
      %code http://landregistry.data.gov.uk/id/region/north-down-and-ards
    %li
      Armagh City Banbridge and Craigavon (formerly Armagh Bainbridge and Craigavon),
      the URI remains
      %code http://landregistry.data.gov.uk/doc/region/armagh-banbridge-and-craigavon
    %li
      Derry City and Strabane (formerly Derry and Strabane), the URI remains
      %code http://landregistry.data.gov.uk/doc/region/derry-and-strabane
