    = succeed "," do

    = succeed "." do
      = link_to "Office for National Statistics", "//www.ons.gov.uk"
    The index applies a statistical method, called a
    = succeed "," do
      = link_to "hedonic regression model", "//www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/methodologies/developmentofasingleofficialhousepriceindex"
    to the various sources of data on property price and attributes
    to produce estimates of the change in house prices each period.

  %p
    The index is published monthly, with Northern Ireland figures updated quarterly.

  %p
    It is advised that low number of sales transactions in some local authorities can
    lead to volatility in the estimates at these levels. Geographies with low number
    of sales transactions should be analysed in the context of their longer-term trends
    rather than focusing on monthly movements. Our
    %a{ href: 'https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/about-the-uk-house-price-index/' }
      guidance page
    provides further detail about our data and its quality.

  %p
    Historic data within this tool is derived. Under the UK HPI, data is
    available from 1995 for England and Wales, 2004 for Scotland and
    2005 for Northern Ireland. A longer back-series has been derived by
    using the historic path of the Office for National Statistics HPI to
    construct a series back to 1968.
