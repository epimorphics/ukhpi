    to the various sources of data on property price and attributes
    to produce estimates of the change in house prices each period.

  %p
    The index is published monthly, with Northern Ireland figures updated quarterly.

  %p
    It is advised that low number of sales transactions in some local authorities can
    lead to volatility in the estimates at these levels. Geographies with low number
    of sales transactions should be analysed in the context of their longer-term trends
    rather than focusing on monthly movements. Our
    %a{ href: 'https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/about-the-uk-house-price-index/' }
      guidance page
    provides further detail about our data and its quality.

    <strong>Note</strong> Three of the Northern Ireland regions have officially
    changed name since this service
    was first set up. While users of the app will see the new names reflected in the
    location search and the map selector, users who utilise the SPARQL
    query function should be aware the data URI for a re-named area has not changed.
    The new local authority names are:
