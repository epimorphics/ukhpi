    The index applies a statistical method, called a
    = succeed "," do
      = link_to "hedonic regression model", "//www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/methodologies/developmentofasingleofficialhousepriceindex"
    to the various sources of data on property price and attributes
    to produce estimates of the change in house prices each period.

  %p
    The index is published monthly, with Northern Ireland figures updated quarterly.

  %p
    It is advised that low number of sales transactions in some local authorities can
    lead to volatility in the estimates at these levels. Geographies with low number
    of sales transactions should be analysed in the context of their longer-term trends
    rather than focusing on monthly movements. Our
    %a{ href: 'https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/about-the-uk-house-price-index/' }
      guidance page
    provides further detail about our data and its quality.

  %p
    Historic data within this tool is derived. Under the UK HPI, data is
    available from 1995 for England and Wales, 2004 for Scotland and
    2005 for Northern Ireland. A longer back-series has been derived by
    using the historic path of the Office for National Statistics HPI to
    construct a series back to 1968.

    %strong Note
    One of the England regions has officially changed name, and two of the Scotland
    regions have changed ONS GSS code since this service was first set up. While
    users of the app will see the new name reflected in the location search
    and the map selector, users who utilise the SPARQL query function should
    be aware that the data URI for a re-named area has not changed.

  %p The new local authority name is:

  %ul.list.list-bullet
    %li
      Folkestone and Hythe (formerly Shepway),
      %br
      the URI remains

  %p In Scotland:
