# Notes and TODOs

## 2017-07-19

* Applied a manual fix to `public/features.json` to address the NI names
change. Will need to be revisited when we change to the new pattern for
generating GeoJSON files. The key changes are:

    armagh-banbridge-and-craigavon is now armagh-city-banbridge-and-craigavon
    derry-and-strabane is now derry-city-and-strabane
    north-down-and-ards is now ards-and-north-down
